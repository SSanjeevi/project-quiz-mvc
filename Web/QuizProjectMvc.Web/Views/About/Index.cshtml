                enter with your Google account. Then you go to Features and from deployed menu click on Create
                New Quiz. Fill in your questions and answers. To set the correct answer click on the letter at
                the beginning (a, b, c, d ...) You need at least 3 questions so you can keep your test with the
                <em>Quiz Save</em> button. You have the option to edit if something has not gone well or if you want
                to add more questions. That is all.

                “A star falls from the sky and into your hands. Then it seeps through your veins and swims inside your blood and becomes every part of you. And then you have to put it back into the sky.

                    And it's the most painful thing you'll ever have to do and that you've ever done. But what's yours is yours. Whether it’s up in the sky or here in your hands. And one day, it'll fall from the sky and hit you in the head real hard and that time, you won't have to put it back in the sky again.”
